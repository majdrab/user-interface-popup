## Overview

### The challenge

Make a user interface that is good looking and user friendly. Make only the visualisation without any functionality.

Take into account all the contents of the diagram with the ability to change the composition of the elements.

In the "Attachments" part it is expected to:
-show all attacked files
-ability to remove an attached file
-ability to add more than one file

Use BEM methodology for class-naming.
